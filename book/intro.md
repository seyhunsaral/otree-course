## What is this?
These are the lecture notes of `oTree` workshop at the *Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods*. 


## Prequisites
Of course you are free dive into the notes and you will be probably able to follow along and build your experiments. But I have several assumptions about the typical audience of the book has the following:
* A general knowledge about experimental methods in social sciences,
* A basic knowledge of programming in Python (or at least in other programming language),
* Ability to use the command line.

If you are missing the technical aspects (item 2 and 3), you can just try to follow and evaluate yourself. Of course Python is a huge general programming language. So we will be using a small subset of it. You can take a look at the `Python Refresher` chapter in order to compare your knowledge or which parts you need to work on in case.

## Good to have
As oTree often requires few codes in different languages like `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS` and so on, any kind of knowledge on either of them helps. I will try to cover also the basics of each of those but the priority will be on teaching the concepts of `oTree`. So for a deeper understanding on these languages, you can refer to other resources. But this is **not necessary for this course**.

## Acknowledgements
    This document is shaped by oTree meetings initiated by `Christoph Engel` at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods. I would like to thank all of the participants of these meetings. I am very grateful to `Oliver Kirchkamp` for his comments during these meetings. I would like to thank `Matteo Ploner` as I benefited from his [publicly available course on oTree](http://matteoploner.eco.unitn.it/courses/oTreeIntro/oTree.html) when I prepare the structure of the course and I was inspired of some of his examples and representations.
