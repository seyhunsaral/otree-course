# Python Essentials 
```{note}
This chapter is in progress
```

Before we move forward, I would like to start with an opinionated comment: **Python is awesome!** You can do almost anything with it: Scrape some web data, build games, do some statistical analysis, create scripts to automatize things on your computer etc. You name it. But it is not just that. It is also a very enjoyable programming language to write in. If you just started to learn python or you intend to in order to use `oTree`, I would say this is probably a good investment as well. 

If you'd like to get to level in Python that you are confortable with, probably this is not the best place. I am writing this chapter to be able kickstart programming in oTree or to show which aspects of Python one should learn about. However, luckily, there are tons of free tutorials out there and some of them are even interactive.
