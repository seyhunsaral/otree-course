Triggers
=========
In oTree, oftentimes you need to trigger some function or some statements and you don't know where you put it. This page will review the triggers systematically.

## Pages
### `after_all_players_arrive`

### `before_next_page()`


## Models


## Subsession
####`creating_session()`
This trigger is executed only once when you create the session. It is true that each round, therefore, subsession is separate in oTree, however, this method will be executed once for each session at the beginning.
