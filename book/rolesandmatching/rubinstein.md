Practice: Rubinstein Bargaining Game
=====================================

We will create a Rubinstein Bargaining Game with follwing properties:

* One pie: 100 ECU
* Two players: One proposes, one accepts/rejects
* Fixed groups
* In each round the proposer and responder switch roles
* In each round the pie dimnishes by 25 ECU 
* If there is no agreement, the game stops after the 4th round. (When the total pie is over)

* After the 4th round, the groups reshuffle for another 4 rounds.
